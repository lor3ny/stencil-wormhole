# Stencil Applications on Tenstorrent Wormhole

This project aims to study the performance of stencil computation on AI accelerators such as Tenstorrent devices.

## Template for tt-metalium compilation


Inside the folder [tt-metal_compilation_template](https://github.com/lor3ny/stencil-wormhole/tree/main/tt-metal_compilation_template), you will find a template that can be used to compile C++ applications using the tt-metalium API as an external dependency.
Follow the instructions in the README file within that folder to learn how to compile everything correctly.
